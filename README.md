# Java-lists-stacks-queues

This repository contains java code which implemnts a Doubly linked list.
Through the use of a doubly linked list of Characters, we are able to implement functions necessary
for Java Character Stacks and Character Queues.

To reduce redudancy the CharList.java file contains methods which are then referenced in either the 
CharStacks.java or CharQueue.java file. 

The CharList.java file also implements a Quick Sort Method which will allow the list/stack/queue to be re-arranged in the proper
order.

This repository also contains serval test files and JUnit Test files which allow us to test whether
our implemented code CharList, CharStack, and CharQueue class is implemented correctly and is functioning how
we wanted it to.
